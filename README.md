## Contributing

Prefer emailing patch sets to the
[official development mailing list](mailto:~watersucks/nix-peek-devel@lists.sr.ht).

While the official repository is located on
[sr.ht](https://git.sr.ht/~watersucks/nix-peek), contributions are also accepted
through GitHub using the
[official mirror](https://github.com/water-sucks/nix-peek), if desired.

Additionally, filing GitHub issues is fine, but consider using the official
issue tracker on [sr.ht](https://todo.sr.ht/~watersucks/nix-peek). All issues
from GitHub will be mirrored there by me anyway.
